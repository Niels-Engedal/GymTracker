## Setup notes for Mikkel
I have made sure that github doesn't upload the video files (neither raw or analyzed) - this is done in the .gitignore.
This means that you'll have to get the "Videos to Analyze" folder from me at some point if you want to run sports2d on your own machine. 
Otherwise just work with the data it creates :)
